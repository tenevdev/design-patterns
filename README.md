### Strategy Pattern
> Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Observer Pattern
> Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically

### Decorator Pattern
> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
